# Online Tech Confs
This is a web app that allows you to view upcoming tech conferences on a calendar.

My submission for the [Suns Out Hacks Out Hackathon](https://sunsouthacksout.devpost.com/) by MLH.

## ⚙️ What I've done
- I used the API being used on https://dev.events/ to fetch online conference events and feed them to the calendar. Nothing too fancy as its my first Hackathon.  

- Then I'm using a hook for when a day is selected on the calendar to render the events on that particular date.

- I'm using a JavaScript calendar library that I had designed some days back for my calendar.

- I've tried to make the UI as close to the summer ☀️ theme as possible.
